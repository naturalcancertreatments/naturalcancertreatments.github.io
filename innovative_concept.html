       <h4>Innovative Concept</h4>
       <p>For innovative ideas that can treat cancer, we need to think out of the box. You are encourage to have an open mindset. Dr. Chang's OPM innovative concept opens a new path to self-healing and regain good health. 
         OPM started when Dr. Chang discovered a few points in his wife hip after pressing using fingers can reduce pain and swelling. Massage on these points is kind of pressing the switch to turn off the pain experienced by his wife. Dr. Chang defined these points as origin points because the cause of pain and discomfort were originated from these points tendon stiffness.
         Through years of clinical research Dr. Chang found and finalized a set of origin points for relieving different parts of pain in our body. Another astonishing findings from Dr. Chang was the consumption of Gingseng helped stabilised his wife conditions and had extended the life span of his wife from seven days to nine months.
         Later study conducted by Dr. Chang concluded that the use of Gingseng can be replaced by ginger. <b>One key observation from Dr. Chang when he took care of his wife in hospice was when the weather was cold there will be cancer patient passed away. This observation leads to the explanation of body coldness or heat energy deficiency shifting our body immune systems to low or turn off body self-healing ability.
         The use of external heating or heat therapy was first validated by Dr. Chang when treating a diabetic patient's wound legs. The patient wound in her legs were recovered or self-healing after the patient leg and body were kept warm for long hours by using red beans put inside a special designed clothing which can be use to reheat of the red beans using microwave.</b> It is crucial for us to learn about the essence of the concept and understand what our body self-healing ability can do. Only then we trust our body self-healing ability and be able to reactivate
         this natural wonder within us. After you have experienced yourself the innovative method of OPM, you will share OPM with your family members and friends.

      <p>OPM teaches us to view our body as a whole systems and that we should understand what causes cancer. Tumour is part of our body and it appears when we aged just as we have grey hairs when we get older.
        Tumour will not harm us, it tells us our body heat energy level is deficient ("tihan體寒") and our body innate self-healing ability is temporary lost.
        We need to be humble to learn about OPM and change our life styles. </p>

       <h4>Seven Steps of OPM </h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Heat therapy (wenfu溫敷)</li>
              <li>Drink thick ginger soup (also known as ginger tea) or ginseng</li>
              <li>Daily Exercises</li>
              <li>Eat (Warm or Hot) foods that increase body heat energy, please refers to the table of foods (<a href="http://www.cch-foundationusa.org/upload/201712_TheWaysOfYuanShiDian_FirstEdition.pdf" target="_blank">Booklet page 92</a>) recommended by Dr. Chang</li>
              <li>Massage origin pain points (antui按推)</li>
              <li>Positive mindset and stable emotion</li>
              <li>Have good rest</li>
          </ul>
       <p>OPM innovative concept has tranformed the way we think about cancer. For further details please read Dr. Chang's OPM booklet and watch Dr. Chang video lectures. </p>
