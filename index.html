       <h4>What you need to know about natural cancer treatments?</h4>
       <p>In this webpage, natural cancer treatments are referring to Origin Point Medicine (OPM). OPM is important for regaining our health by enhancing our body self-healing ability.
         Our body's innate ability to maintain good health is the natural health system.
         Cancer occurrence indicates our innate ability is temporary not working. We need to know how to revitalise this innate ability.
         The health of our bodies is determine by our lifestyle. When our body and mind are not affected by the fear of unnecessary stress our body will recover faster.
         It is crucial for us to know what causes cancer and how we can regain our health.
       </p>

       <h4>Why Origin Point Medicine (OPM)?</h4>
       <p>OPM in Chinese is known as "YuanShiDian 原始點". OPM sometimes is also called Origin Point Therapy (OPT). OPM was discovered by a Chinese medical doctor from Taiwan called Dr. Chao-Han Chang. Dr. Chang first discovered OPM since 2006 when his wife was suffering from breast cancer.
          Since then many of his patients have benefited from using OPM. Later, Dr. Chang has founded the C.C.H. Medical Foundation (<a href="http://cch-foundation.org" target="_blank"> www.cch-foundation.org </a>
          for English <a href="http://cch-foundationusa.org/en/" target="_blank"> www.cch-foundationusa.org </a>) to promote OPM to the world. For more information about the story of Dr. Chang's discovery of OPM
          please visit <a href="http://origin-point-medicine.org/dr-chang-chao-han-story-part-1/" target="_blank"> Dr Chang’s Story. </a><p>

       <h4>What is OPM?</h4>
       <p>OPM is an innovative method discovered by Dr. Chang. OPM can revitalise our body innate self-healing ability. The basic concept is based on Traditional Chinese Medicine.
          But, OPM is a novel concept that has revolutionised the way we think about cancer. Based on clinical studies conducted by Dr. Chang
          he proposed that cancer occurrence indicates our body heat energy is deficient ("tihan體寒"). Therefore, our body innate ability is temporary not working properly and we need to increase our body heat energy
          in order to revitalise this innate self-healing ability. There are three steps to increase our body heat energy. The first step is the use of heat therapy ("wenfu") from an electric heating pad, e.g. sleep on a heating pad,
          can transfer heat energy from outside source to our body. The second step is the daily consumption of thick ginger soup. The third step is daily exercises such as walking, climbing stairs, etc. These three steps are crucial for increasing our body heat energy.
          Besides the three steps to increase our body heat energy, Dr. Chang also found that massage ("antui=pressing and rubbing") of the origin points in our body can reduce the cause of pain in our body.
          In addition, Dr. Chang suggested that consumption of food such as ginger, gingseng, pepper, chili, etc. that can increase body heat energy is vital for cancer patients and avoid eating fruits and uncooked vegetables.
          The other key factor is having a good rest to maintain a positive and peaceful state of mind.

       <h4>Our health is determine by us.</h4>

       <p>The understanding of OPM as a natural cancer treatment is critical for making the decision that determines our health. </p>
